Description: The ecomet package provides tools for processing and analyzing mass
    spectrometry–based metabolomics data in ecological and evolutionary
    contexts. It establishes a standardized pipeline that integrates MS1
    feature–abundance tables with MS2 spectral similarity to generate
    common data products, including principal component analyses (PCA),
    chemical dendrograms where tips represent compounds, principal
    coordinates analyses (PCoA), and differential expression analyses.
    Unlike existing metabolomics toolkits that focus primarily on
    biomedical or cheminformatics applications, ecomet is designed
    explicitly for ecometabolomics. It emphasizes workflows that link
    metabolomic variation to ecological data, making it easier to move
    from raw mass spectrometry files to reproducible, comparative analyses
    of plant chemical diversity.
